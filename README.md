# Poison Apple, a fansite dedicated to Nirvana

Made in 1999, back in the days of Altavista and Yahoo, **Poison Apple** was my first website ever, probably coded using Microsoft FrontPage 98. The internet thing was only starting for me and learning how to make a website seemed like a great way to express myself.

This repository was created to keep it alive for as long as possible. Disclaimer: contains splash pages, frames, page counters, and "best viewed with" warnings.
